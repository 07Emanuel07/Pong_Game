# Pong Game Project

This Python application implements the classic Pong game using the `turtle` module. Players can control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, with a scoreboard tracking the points scored by each player. 

## Key Features

**Game Setup with Turtle Graphics:**
  - The game uses the `turtle` module to create a graphical window where the game takes place. The screen is set up with a black background and a title.

**Paddle Class:**
  - The `Paddle` class defines the paddles used by the players. Each paddle can move up and down in response to user input.

**Ball Class:**
  - The `Ball` class defines the ball used in the game. The ball moves automatically and bounces off the paddles and walls.

**Scoreboard Class:**
  - The `Scoreboard` class tracks the scores of both players and updates the display whenever a point is scored.

**Game Loop and Controls:**
  - The main game loop updates the screen, moves the ball and checks for collisions with the paddles and walls. User input is handled to control the paddles.

**User Controls:**
  - The application listens for key presses to move the paddles up and down.
